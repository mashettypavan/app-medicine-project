## API Integration Issue
I attempted to integrate the API following the documentation provided in the Postman collection (https://docs.evitalrx.in/api-for-fulfillment-portal/introduction). However, despite multiple attempts, the provided API key (wFIMP75eG1sQEh8vVAdXykgzF4mLhDw3) is not working for me. I tested the API calls but received authentication errors, preventing successful data retrieval from the endpoint.
